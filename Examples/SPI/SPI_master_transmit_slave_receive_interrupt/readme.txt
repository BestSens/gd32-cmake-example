  This example is based on the GD32450i-EVAL board, it shows master send data and 
slave receive data use intterupt mode.

  1.Modify files: example/SPI/SPI_master_transmit_slave_receive_interrupt/main.h, choose
to disable CRC function.
  #define SPI_CRC_ENABLE       0
  After the communication is completed, if the data received equal to the data sent, LED1
turn on, and if not, LED1 turn off.

  2.Modify files: example/SPI/SPI_master_transmit_slave_receive_interrupt/main.h, choose
to enable CRC function.
  #define SPI_CRC_ENABLE       1
  After the communication is completed, if the CRC checking is passed, LED1 turn on,
and if not, LED1 and LED2 turn off.

  Connect SPI1 NSS  PIN(PI0) TO SPI3 NSS  PIN(PE11).
  Connect SPI1 SCK  PIN(PI1) TO SPI3 SCK  PIN(PE12).
  Connect SPI1 MISO PIN(PI2) TO SPI3 MISO PIN(PE13).
  Connect SPI1 MOSI PIN(PI3) TO SPI3 MOSI PIN(PE14).
