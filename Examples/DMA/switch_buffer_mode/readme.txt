  This demo is based on the GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to use DMA switch 
buffer mode.
  In this demo, TIMER1 is used to trigger the transfer of DMA0 channel 7 every 500ms 
interval, and the data in buffer 1 and buffer 2 are moved to the output control register 
of GPIOE, then LED1 and LED2 will flash at 500ms interval.
