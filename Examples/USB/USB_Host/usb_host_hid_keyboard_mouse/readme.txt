  This demo is based on the GD32450i-EVAL-V1.2 board, and it provides a description of 
how to use the USBFS/USBHS host peripheral on the GD32F4xx devices.

  Jump the JP17 to SDRAM.
  Jump the JP12/JP15 to LCD.

  When an USB Device is attached to the Host port, the device is enumerated and checked
whether it can support HID device, if the attached device is HID one, when the user
press the user key, the mouse or the keyboard application is launched.

  If a mouse has been attached, moving the mouse will move the 'x' in the LCD screen and 
pressing the button will show the magenta color rectangle in the LCD screen.

  If a keyboard has been attached, pressing the keyboard will print the the char of the button
in the LCD screen.

Note: In the USB Host HID class, two layouts are defined in the usbh_standard_hid.h file
      and could be used (Azerty and Querty)
        #define QWERTY_KEYBOARD
        //#define AZERTY_KEYBOARD

     The User can eventually add his own layout by editing the HID_KEYBRD_Key array
   in the usbh_standard_hid.c file.

  The demo support the functions of host suspend and wakeup. The macro of USBFS_LOW_POWER/USBHS_LOW_POWER 
can be set to 1 to test the suspend and wakeup. User can press Tamper key to make the USB host enter the 
suspended state.If you want to use the general wakeup mode, please press the Wakeup key. If you 
want to use the remote wakeup mode, please operating device, such as move the mouse or press the 
keyboard. And you can press the User key to keep the program running.
